    According to WHO, Between 1998-2017, earthquakes caused nearly 750 000 deaths globally, 
    more than half of all deaths related to natural disasters. More than 125 million people 
    were affected by earthquakes during this time period, meaning they were injured, 
    made homeless, displaced or evacuated during the emergency phase of the disaster.

     <div class= "para2">  
   It is important for us, the habitors of this planet to be aware and recognize the danger of this natural disaster. 
   The idea of being more advocate on the outcomes and how we can be prepared for the next disasters are my inspirations to create this project. 
   Earthquakes can strike suddenly and without warning.

        WHAT CAUSES EARTHQUAKE?: 
    </div>
    
    
     <div class= "para3">  
An earthquake is a violent and abrupt shaking of the ground, caused by movement between tectonic plates along a fault line in the earth's crust. 
Earthquakes can result in the ground shaking, soil liquefaction, landslides, fissures, avalanches, fires and tsunamis. 
The extent of destruction and harm caused by an earthquake depends on multiple factors i.e. magnitude, intensity and duration, etc. In the following visualization, we will give you a glimpse of the most 'important' earthquakes that happened in the past month / last 30 days.

        Using the data set of the significant earthquakes happened in the past month which I extracted from <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards'>USGS</a>,  
        we can see the area where the earthquakes happend recently with most significant impact. 
        Moreover, I also applied the data pulled from USGS of the most 'deadly' earthquakes that happend in the past century. 
        Comparing the two data sets gives us insights on 'how' we can avoid visiting the area and be prepared for the natural disasters in that area.

    <div class ="subpara2">
       The "Ring of Fire", also called the Circum-Pacific belt, is the zone of earthquakes surrounding the Pacific Ocean- about 90% of the world's earthquakes occur there. The next most seismic region (5-6% of earthquakes) is the Alpide belt (extends from Mediterranean region, eastward through Turkey, Iran, and northern India.
